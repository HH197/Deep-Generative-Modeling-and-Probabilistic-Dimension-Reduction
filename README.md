Here, I have re-engineered the implementation of the [scVI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0229-2) tool, developed by Lopez *et al.* at the University of Berkeley, using [Pyro](https://pyro.ai/), [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/), and Pytorch resulted in fewer lines of code, more efficiency, and reliability. scVI is a a general dimension reduction and data imputation tool which can be trained very efficiently even for large datasets.

The Colab notebook contains a short report of my implementation, interpretations, and testing.
